    Important Performance Note: The CNN face recognizer should only be used in 
    real-time if you are working with a GPU (you can use it with a CPU, but expect 
    less than 0.5 FPS which makes for a choppy video). 
    Alternatively (you are using a CPU), you should use the HoG method
    (or even OpenCV Haar cascades covered in a future blog post) and expect adequate speeds.
